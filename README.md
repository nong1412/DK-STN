A Domain Knowledge Embedded Spatio-Temporal Network Model for MJO Forecast

Understanding and predicting the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is fundamental for forecasting precipitation and preventing disasters. To date, long-term and accurate MJO prediction has been a pending problem for researchers.

This project shows the code of our MJO prediction with domain knowledge embedded spatio-temporal network model.
